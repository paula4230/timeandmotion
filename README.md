# timeandmotion

## One-click logging for start and stop task motion. Tracks total time spent on a project.

The timeandmotion tracker was one of the projects I built while doing bootcamp in 2019. I was handling back-office tasks at a BPO for my job back then and we were required to track our activity for each ticket -- we had to log the time we started and ended using Microsoft Excel. Eventually, I got annoyed so I just turned it into one of my bootcamp projects. As developers, we write code for 30 minutes to 2 weeks for a task that tasks us 5 minutes to complete (just kidding, doing time and motion tracking was repetitive and boring). 

This was just the beginning of my coding journey so expect not so clean code, but it also taugh me how to turn business logic into software to make people's lives easier.
